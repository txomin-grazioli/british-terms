Relatively new for Edinburgh pubs, the Royal McGregor has established itself over its 10 years as a friendly, comfortable place to catch a meal. Its haggis options are particularly enticing. As a starter, there are haggis fritters with sweet chilli and honey dressing, and for a main course, you can try the Highland burger with haggis and whisky sauce.",

The combined skill of Mary, a graduate of Caprigiani Gelato University in Italy, and the sweeping array of sumptuous choices make this spot a no brainer. From almost sinful sundaes and centre-filled chocolates to unfathomable hot chocolate floats, even one taste of Mary’s Milk Bar is the sweetest spiritual experience. All in all, a welcomed nod to the popular cultural trend of milk bars back in the day.",
